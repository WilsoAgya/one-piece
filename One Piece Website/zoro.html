        Roanoro Zoro, also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro, is the swordsman of the Straw Hat Pirates who was formerly
        a bounty hunter and the second member to join the Straw Hat Pirates. Zoro was born in Shimotsuki Village, a small village located in East
        Blue. As a child, Zoro discovered his passion for swordsmanship and began training at an early age in Isshin Dojo, a
        small dojo located in his village. He became a master at his very own swordmanship style known as the Three Sword 
        and his rigorous amount of training has led him to become one of the most strong and powerful out of the Straw Hat
        Pirates. Zoro's motive for being a Pirate is to become the greatest swordsman that the world has ever known in order
        to pay respects to his late childhood friend that he made a promise to.
