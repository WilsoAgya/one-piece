        Nami also known as "Cat Burglar" Nami is the Straw Hat Pirate's navigator and the second member to join
        the Straw Hat Pirates. She was raised in a village known as Cocoyasi Village along side her adoptive sister
        Nojiko. Nami and Nojiko were taken in by a lady named "Bell-Mere" and the trio over the years would be become very
        close up until Bell-Mere's early death. Nami originally joined the Straw Hats so that she could rob them and buy
        back her village from Arlong, but after the Straw Hats defeated Arlong she became a legitimate member of the 
        Straw Hat Pirates. Nami's reason for being a pirate is so that she can achieve her goal
        creating a map of the entire ocean.
