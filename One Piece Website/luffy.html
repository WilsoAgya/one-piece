        <p><h1>Biography</h1>
        Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" serves as the main protagonist in the story of One Piece. He is the 
        captain of the "Straw Hat Pirates" an infamous group of notorious pirates that sail across the Grand Line searching
        for the One Piece. Luffy was born and raised in "Foosha Village" a small village located in the East Blue along side
        his brother Portgas D. Ace. At the age of 7 Luffy's body turned into rubber reason being that he accidentally ate 
        the devil fruit, "Gum-Gum". During his childhood he befriended a pirate known as "Red-Haired Shanks" who would have a larger influence on 
        Luffy's life. Shanks gave Luffy his iconic Straw Hat signifying Luffy's promise that they would meet again one fateful day
        as the most notorious pirate that ever sailed the seas.
