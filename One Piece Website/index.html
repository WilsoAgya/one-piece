        <p><h1>Overview</h1>
        In the anime, "One Piece" the Straw Hat pirates are the main group of pirates that the story pays most attention to. The originated
        from the East Blue but as the story progresses more members from different areas across the Grand Line. The name
        "Straw Hats" derives from Luffy's iconic Straw Hat that was given to him by his pirate role model Red-Haired Shanks. 
        Throughout the story so far these pirates have been through many adventures and have won many battles due to not only
        how powerful each member of the Straw Hat pirates are but also by how efficiently all members work together with one
        another to achieve the objective.
